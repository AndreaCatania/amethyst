//! # IMPORTANT:
//! This library is not meant to stay inside the amethyst project.
//!
//! Actually this is here only to make it more simple to develop.
//! The idea is to move this outside once it's almost done.

//! # Amethyst default physics engine
//! This is the default Amethyst physics engine.
//! To use this you have to register the `PhysicsServers` returned by the fn `create_physics`
//! that is located in this crate, using the fn `Application::with_physics`.
//!
//! Follow the instructions of Phythyst to make more info about it.
//!
//! # Dev info
//!
//! ## Naming
//! Since NPhysics doesn't use any prefix to identify its structures this implementation take care
//! to append the prefix `Np` to any struct that come from NPhysics.
//! In this way is possible to have a clear distinction of what is what.
//! Example: `RigidBody` and `NpRigidBody`.
